\section{Introduction}

This paper looks into the \cc in the Kuadrant project.
Cyclomatic complexity is a metric design to indicate the complexity of an application.
In the Kuadrant project, there are multiple applications, and combining these metrics gives some interesting insights.

The main goal is to learn what \cc is and how best to apply it to a project.
Using the Kuadrant project is a means to an end.
The project has a large enough code base spread across multiple repos and languages to be interesting.

\subsection{Kuadrant Project}
The Kuadrant Project is a collection of applications that provides gateway policies for kubernetes and cross multiply clusters.
There is more to the project than its tag line and the components that are shipped with every release.
Other repos add value to the project, such as the test suite and website repos.
