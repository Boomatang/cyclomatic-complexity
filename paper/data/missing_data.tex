\section{Missing Information}
With looking into \cc and how to use the metric, it becomes clear there is some information that would be added to the usefulness.
The idea of code churn which would highlight functions that have changed within a project could show if functions with high \cc are being updated regularly.
This would indicate that the function is overly complex and people do not understand it enough to create valid updates the first time around.

What would also be good to know is how often a function with a low \cc score is being used.
If the number is very low it could indicate the premautre abstracutions, which is not great for the project.

I currently don't have a means to record a value for code churn, or even have a number for often change is required to be regarded as churn.
This value of churn I think would be very taileried to the project to which the metric is coming from.
